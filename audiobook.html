<h1>The Ruby King</h1>
<h3>Chapter 1: Battle For The Bridge</h3>
<br>
<section>
<p>The lead scout had been running for hours. Her feet were silent and swift as she navigated the mountain paths,
employing stealth in the dark of night.
No enemy units spotted. Upon reaching her destination, she crouched behind a boulder and peeked around the corner, watching from a safe distance.
In her sights: the key to the success of this raid; the bridge that leads to the city of Mesa. Nothing but the usual garrisons guarding the bridge,
she could see them clearly on this dark night, chainmail reflecting the glow of fire. She breathed in the cool midnight air, reassured by the low muffle of soldiers' converstaion.
"Perfect" she whispered to herself as she crawled away, making her way back to the raiding party to report her findings. Unkowingly, she had triggered the early detection system, 
and was about to set it off a second time on the return journey.</p> 
<br>

Zobi nestled himself amongst the tall grass, still damp in the early morning hours. He chose his spot strategically; an elevated wedge of cliffside.
One of the few natural formations that make a great lookout. This was the young prince's first assignment as commander; To stop the raiding party and secure the bridge.
His telescope conveyed the details of his adversaries, observing them as they marched in single file along the mountain path. Counting their numbers, noting weapons and formations.<br>
"That can not be all of them." Zobi heard that familiar voice chirping. He peeled his eye away from his telescope, frustrated but not suprised that his step-brother had disobeyed his command.
<br>
"you left your post."<br>
"I left a note". Rayja fired back with his signature sarcastic dismissive tone.<br>
Zobi exhaled a laboured sigh of disappointment as he looked away from him and continued. "Aakial was right, they took cover under the storm and marched through the night, 
they must be exhausted".<br>
"That can not be all of them Zobi, I bet some of them are taking the walls path. Can't be that many of them on that path, it will be their elites manoeuvering for a flank attack....
They must know they've been seen by now brother". Rayja said as he turned over on his back and inhaled a lung full of air, interlacing his fingers behind his head, his lackadaiscial demeanour
annoyed Zobi. Still, he trusted in his skill and ability, enough to warrant the question. "And how do YOU know that?" Zobi enquired, the frustration in his voice was discernible.<br>
"I'm sure their scouts would have seen us from across the ravine, it's my gut feeling. If we attack now, we will have some element of surprise, just fling a few stones and arrows. Let us seize the day little brother".
Rayja was looking directly at Zobi, eyes fixed as he flexed the influence of big brother, causing Zobi to hestitate before he balked.<br>
"We must consult with the officers first".<br>
"We have a small time window, we will have their backs to the wall and beat them to the bridge; The perfect chokepoint." Rayja spoke as a salesman, full of conviction and blandishment. "C'mon, don't be a slow-bi, Zobi". Without another moment for contemplation or consultation. Rayja rose to his feet and belted out "BLOOD CHALLENEGE". A loud bluster echoed through the valley and 
bounced off the mounatin walls. Sending waves of panic through Zobi, still prone on his belly amongst the tall grass. The raiding party stopped to look across the ravine. Hardly any of them were surprised
to see the warrior prince. Standing tall and hoisting a red cloth in his hand, waving and whipping in the wind. This is exactly what was making Zobi so nervous. Rayja is unpredictable and thirsts for glory.
He thought quickly as he rose to his feet while his captain came galloping to him, prompted by the unxpected announcment of their presence.<br>
"Prince Zobi?" The captain inquired urgently.<br>
"Gather yout troops and gallop to the bridge, we must get there before they do, RIDE!"<br>
"Sire" The captains response was rapid, swinging his horse around before breaking into full gallop. The scramble for the bridge was on.
"you see, now we are unorganized". Zobi arraigned furiously.<br>
"Relax, now the threat of projectiles forces them to hoist up their shields, this will wear them down further". Rayja retorted with an annoying, self assured smile. "ARCHERS, SLINGERS, give them some light volleys, but only use half your payloads".<br>
"You overstep, I am commander here."<br>
"And I, but your humble advisor and strategist, little brother, and I will win the day for you".<br>
<br>

The two small war parties met at the bridge. Behind the raiders; The narrow mountain path from which they came, before them stood the defenders. In formation and blocking the bridge gateway to the open countryside and fields of Mesa. The tension was high as the winds howled. Beasts, leather and metal in a stand-off.

Zobi sought to take the intiative. Eager to display his worth to his warriors, to prove that he is not some spoiled fool mounted on a horse, but before he could gather himself, Rayja spoke out of turn. 
"So... do you accept my challenge?" A small smirk accompanied his words.<br>
"Do you know to whom you speak? I, am Drovin, leader of this war party, but you... You do not garner the chief's armour. Seems our friends have a little ranking problem". Drovin turned to his raiders as 
he spoke, goading them for a chuckle. By now, Zobi was growing increasingly flustered, he interrupted them and finally assummed the mantle of commander. "Your attack is thwarted, we have a garrison guarding the wall's path.
There will be no raiding this day, go home and we won't have to kill you." He said, relieved that he managed to speak without a stammer.<br>
"You can pay us to leave."<br>
"I only brought loose change" Zobi fired back with uncharacteristic wit then conitnued "How long have you been marching? We have the numbers, we spotted your scouts in the night, you don't have the element of surprise,
go home, and live."<br>
Rayja however, was more interested in glory than diplomacy, he took his armour off and sheathed his sword in his saddle while giving his horse a gentle pat. Upon seeing that all eyes have turned to him, he addressed Drovin directly.
"I like your dagger, can I have it when I win?" Rayja was acutley aware of group dynamics and was deliberatley manipulating the situation. A decorated dagger is usually a family loom, not customarily used as a prize
in blood challenge rituals. Rayja's unregalness led Drovin to ignore him, more in favour of speaking to the commander, but as he turned away, Rajya saw his opportunity. He recognised this man from the annual games from many years ago, when the treaty was still recognised.<br>
"Right... You're Drovin, now I remember, you're the one who fell in horse shit at the games." Rayja spoke with a loud and theatrical tone, turning to his warriors and provoking an eruption of laughter.
Some of the raiders were also amused by the recollection of this incident and joined in with sheepish muffled chuckles. Drovin's face conveyed scorn as his head recoiled back slighlty.
He scanned Rayja up and down with narrowed eyes. Disgust and disapproval evident in his contemptuous glare. Then he spoke in a deeper and more solemn tone. "You boy, need a lesson in etiquette."<br>
"I do?" Rayja asked as he pointed at himself, exaggerating his words and turning to his warriors. "I do". He emphasized as he nodded excessivley, once again igniting cheers from his warriors.
By now Zobi felt like he had lost all control of the situation. He anxiously weighed up his options, his body twitching in an attempt to stay composed. He dismounted his horse and grabbed Rayja by the arm. 
"You must stop this now".
Rayja looked at the red cloth wrapped around his hand and stated: "A blood challenge has been called. We will fight. You can do as you wish after I beat shit face Drovin."<br>
"It was a small smudge on my boot you creatin. Your tongue needs tempering boy, you speak lies for cheap chortles, and I will break your face and wipe you off my heal like horse shit." Drovin snapped back, the sound of muffled rage billowing in his throat. He evoked a blanketing silence. Rayja knew he was getting to Drovin, he was inside his head and forcing his hand. He knew an angry and ungrounded fighter is prone to making mistakes. Drovin however,
would prove to be a proud warrior and not so easily rattled. He regained composure and spoke calmly. "Fine, my dagger? Your horse."<br>
"What?" Rayja objected, having been caugt off gurad.<br>
"Afraid?" Droving insinuated with mockery and derision.<br>
Not to be outdone, Rayja masked his objection with a confident smile. "I accept".<br>

The blood challenge was more a tradition that law. Merley eight years ago, Mesa and the mountain tribes had a treaty of mutual respect and security. It ensured the mountain paths remained open for trade and safe passage.
Over time, the deal wore out of favour. The ongoing threat of bandits was never fully addressed, and the blame game and political posturing saw an end to the treaty. However, Mesa and the mounatin tribes were off the same lineage.
Their language shared common roots, their warrior code of honour was a core part of their identities. Throughout it's history, the city state of Mesa had seen bloodshed, invasions, occupations and had 
switched hands between rival factions. War was a constant.<br>

Rayja and Drovin stood at opposite ends of the bridge, backs turned to one another. Behind the dualists stood seven warriors respectivley. forming human barriers at each end of the bridge.
The blood challenge ritual had begun. Follwing the cadence of striking shields, the two warriors edged forward one step at a time. Aiming for the strand of rope that lay at the half way mark of the bridge. Marking where the oppoenents are to meet for the unarmed dual. As the final staredown was underway, Rayja started making mock sniffing gestures and noises. Once again, disrespecting Drovin who tensed up with fury and blood lust.
With keen eyes, Rayja noted his opponent's lead hand twitching and clenched as he leaned his body forward. He had a pretty good idea what was coming at him.

With a thunderous clamour, a war hammer struck a bronze shield, sending a massive clang of metal reverberating through the cool mountain air. Drovin launched forward and threw his lead left hand immediatley.
Rayja, having predicting this attack, stepped back and moved his head to the right. slipping the twitch telegraphed punch. Drovin followed through with a fully loaded right hand, thrown with murderous intent.
Once agin, Rayja was anticipating what was coming, a ferocious but hasty one-two combination. He moved to his left to get out of the way and let his opponent overextend. Drovin's rash and vehement charge left him open, moving too far forward and with too much force to stop. His hands, not in position to guard his face. With the trap now sprung, Rayja planted his feet, lined up his shot and struck drovin with a counter-right of his own, clipping him on the soft part of the nose and dropping him. He turned to his warriors and threw his hands up in the air as he roared, demanding that cheers
and noise be returned. Drovin got up and wiped the blood off his face, feeling like he had been played, but still determined to vanquish his foe, who he was eying up with extreme scorn and resentment. Rayaj turned to focus on his opponent, he flexed his arms and lowered his stance, squaring off with Drovin as they slowly circled each other. First round went to Rayja, but the fight was not over. Seeing Drovin hesitant and on the backfoot, Rayja tried tried to seize the initiative, but Drovin launched forward at the same time. The dualing warriors clashed in the centre and huddled, tying up each others' arms. Rayja, never one to miss an opportunity to show off, started acting like a fool, garnering laughs and cheers from his supporters, and driving Drovin further into an unfocued rage. The dualist broke from the huddle and both stepped back. Drovin immediatley threw two pounches, a curving hook aimed at the temple which Rayja ducked, then a second punch straighht at his face. Rayja once again evaded and parried the incoming attacks then poked his tongue out to further aggravate him, his antics were making Drovin predictable. The war hammer struck the shield once again, indicating that grappling is now permitted. With a loud and determined cry, Drovin launched forward and wrapped his arms around Rayja's waist, intiating a messy takedown followed by a scrappy struggle. The two fighter dragged one another to the ground. Rayja was no stranger to messy dirty fighting, he began tying up Drovin's arms and controlling his head, denying Droving the chance to strike as they rolled on the bridge, trying to kill one another, each vowing for the top position. This fight was now a battle of stamina and brute strength, but Rayja had some tricks up his sleeved. He seized an opening and grabbed Drovin by the elbow and wrist and levered him, rolling him onto his back and achieving the contested top mount position. Now he saw his chance to finish this fight. with brutal efficiency rained down a barrage of vicious elbow strikes on Drovin. The fight was no longer a spectacle of striking, skill or technique. It had transcended into a crude and brutal slog. Rayja did not stop his assauly untill he was sure that Drovin had been subdued. The spectaotrs watched in solemn silence as the dual drew to its shockingly violent conclusion. Ryaja had bested his opponent. Drovin lay on the ground, barley conscious, bleeding and rolling back and forth like an over turned turtle.<br>

<p>The warrior prince got up and with single motion slicked back his royal hair. He turned to his warriors and raised his hand in triumph and belted out a war cry. Warriors of Mesa answered with war cried of their own, drowning the sound of everything else as Drovin was being helped to his feet. Rayja strolled over to his enemies, more liuke a jester than a warrior and snatched Drovin's decorated dagger from an unenthusiastic trophy holder.</p>
<p>"Thank you very much" Rayja chirped, turning to his warriors and raising the trophy for them to see. They in turn, raised their weapons and cheered on their warrior prince, he had scored a great victory and prevented a full out battle, or so it seemed</p>
<p>"You have achieved nothing arrogant prince" A voice came sharp and loud across the bridge, cutting down the last remenants of cheers. A short and stocky figure stood at the front of the raiding party, looking unimpressed and unconvinced. "You bested Drovin, you scored the little prick knife, but we are not leaving."</p>
<p>Zobi immediatley objected to this. "The law is clear, the blood challenge is finished and Rayja spared his life, you are to leave at once."</p>
<p>The law, boy, is nothing but words. Out here, there are no laws."</p>
<p>Have you no honour? Zobi asked with disappointment.</p>
<p>We will have what is ours.</p>
<p>Rayja was not amused by this new challenger's attempt to take command of the raiding party. "You will take your defeat and go home</p>
